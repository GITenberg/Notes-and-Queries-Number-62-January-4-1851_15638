<h3>OUR THIRD VOLUME.</h3>

  <p>The commencement of our Third Volume affords an opportunity, which we
  gladly seize, of returning our best thanks to those kind friends and
  correspondents to whom we are indebted for our continued success. We
  thank them all heartily and sincerely; and we trust that the volume, of
  which we now present them with the First Number, will afford better proof
  of our gratitude than mere words. Such improvements as have suggested
  themselves in the course of the fourteen months during which NOTES AND
  QUERIES has been steadily working up its way to its present high position
  shall be effected; and nothing shall be wanting, on our part, which may
  conduce to maintain or increase its usefulness. And here we would
  announce a slight change in our mode of publication, which we have
  acceded to at the suggestion of several parties, in order to meet what
  may appear to many of our readers a trivial matter, but which is found
  very inconvenient in a business point of view&mdash;we allude to the
  diversity of price in our Monthly Parts.</p>

  <p>To avoid this, and, as we have said, to meet the wishes of many of our
  friends, we propose to publish a fifth or supplementary number in every
  month in which there are only four Saturdays, so as to make the Monthly
  Parts one shilling and threepence each in all cases, with the exception
  of the months of January and July, which will include the Index of the
  preceding Half-yearly Volume, at the price of one shilling and ninepence
  each. Thus the yearly subscription to NOTES AND QUERIES, either in
  unstamped weekly Numbers or Monthly Parts, will be eighteen
  shillings.</p>

  <p>Trusting that this, and all the other arrangements we are proposing to
  ourselves, may meet with the approbation of our friends and subscribers,
  we bid them Farewell! and wish them,&mdash;what we trust they wish to
  NOTES AND QUERIES&mdash;a Happy New Year, and many of them!</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>OLD BALLAD UPON THE "WINTER'S TALE."</h3>

  <p>Some of your correspondents may be able to give me information
  respecting an old ballad that has very recently fallen in my way, on a
  story similar to that of Shakspeare's <i>Winter's Tale</i>, and in some
  particulars still more like Greene's novel of <i>Pandosto</i>, upon which
  the <i>Winter's Tale</i> was founded. You are aware that the earliest
  known edition of Greene's novel is dated 1588, although there is room to
  suspect that it had been originally <!-- Page 2 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page2"></a>{2}</span> printed before that year:
  the first we hear of the <i>Winter's Tale</i> is in 1611, when it was
  acted at court, and it was not printed until it appeared in the folio of
  1623.</p>

  <p>The ballad to which I refer has for title <i>The Royal Courtly
  Garland, or Joy after Sorrow</i>: it is in ordinary type, and was
  "Printed and sold in Aldermary Churchyard, London." It has no date, and
  in appearance does not look older than from perhaps, 1690 to 1720; it may
  even be more recent, as at that period it is not easy to form a correct
  opinion either from typography or orthography: black-letter has a
  distinguishing character at various periods, so as to enable a judgment
  to be formed within, perhaps, ten years, as regards an undated
  production: but such is not the case with Roman type, or white-letter.
  What I suspect, however, is that this ballad is considerably older, and
  that my copy is only a comparatively modern reprint with some
  alterations; it requires no proof, at this time of day, to show that it
  was the constant habit of our old publishers of ephemeral literature to
  reprint ballads without the slightest notice that they had ever appeared
  before. This, in fact, is the point on which I want information, as to
  <i>The Royal Courtly Garland, or Joy after Sorrow</i>. Can any of your
  correspondents refer me to an older copy, or do they know of the
  existence of one which belongs to a later period? I cannot be ignorant of
  DR. RIMBAULT'S learning on such matters, and I make my appeal especially
  to him.</p>

  <p>It is very possible that it may bear a different title in other
  copies, and for the sake of identification I will furnish a few extracts
  from the various "parts" (no fewer than six) into which the ballad is
  divided; observing that they fill a closely printed broadside, and that
  the production is entirely different from Jordan's versification of the
  <i>Winter's Tale</i>, under the title of <i>The Jealous Duke and the
  injured Duchess</i>, which came out in his <i>Royal Arbor of Loyal
  Poesie</i>, 8vo. 1664. It is singular that two ballads, hitherto wholly
  unknown, should have been written upon the same incidents of the same
  drama, although we are yet without evidence that Jordan's effusion was
  ever published as a broadside.</p>

  <p>Not a single name is given to any of the persons in my <i>Royal
  Courtly Garland</i>, but the places of action are reversed exactly in the
  same way as in Greene's novel of <i>Pandosto</i>, where what Shakspeare
  represents as passing in Sicily occurs in Bohemia, and <i>vice versa</i>;
  moreover, the error of representing Bohemia as a maritime country belongs
  to my ballad, as well as to the novelist and the dramatist. The King of
  Bohemia, jealous of an "outlandish prince," who he suspected had
  intrigued with his queen, employs his cup-bearer to poison the prince,
  who is informed by the cup-bearer of the design against his life.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"For fear of the king the prince dare not stay:</p>
      <p>The wind being fair, he sailed away,</p>
      <p>Saying, I will escape from his blood-thirsty hand</p>
      <p>By steering away to my native land."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Not long after his departure, the queen, "who had never conceived
  before" (which varies both from Greene and Shakspeare), produces a
  daughter, which the king resolves to get rid of by turning it adrift at
  sea in "a little boat." He so informs the queen, and she in great grief
  provides the outfit for the infant voyager:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"A purse of rare jewels she placed next her skin,</p>
      <p>And fasten'd it likewise securely within;</p>
      <p>A chain round her neck, and a mantle of gold,</p>
      <p>Because she her infant no more should behold."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is revealed to the king in a dream that his wife is innocent, but
  she soon dies of a broken-heart. Meanwhile, the prince, on his return to
  his own dominions, marries, and has a son. The infant princess is driven
  on shore in his kingdom, and is saved by an old shepherd, and brought up
  by him and his wife as their own child, they carefully concealing the
  riches they had found in the "little boat."</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"This child grew up, endued with grace,</p>
      <p>A modest behaviour, a sweet comely face;</p>
      <p>And being arrived at the age of fifteen,</p>
      <p>For beauty and wisdom few like <i>her</i> were seen."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>"Her" is misprinted <i>him</i> in the original, and the whole, as may
  be expected, is not a first-rate specimen of typography. The son of the
  prince sees and falls in love with the supposed shepherd's daughter, and,
  to avoid the anger of the prince his father, he secretly sails away with
  her and the old shepherd. By a storm they are driven on the coast of
  Bohemia:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"A violent storm on the sea did arise,</p>
      <p>Drove them to Bohemia; they are took for spies;</p>
      <p>Their ship was seized, and they to prison sent:</p>
      <p>To confine them a while the king's fully bent."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Here we arrive at an incident which is found in Greene, but which
  Shakspeare had the judgment to avoid, making the termination of his drama
  as wonderful for its art, as delightful for its poetry. Greene and my
  ballad represent the king of Bohemia falling in love with his own
  daughter, whom he did not recognise. She effectually resisted his
  entreaties, and he resolves "to hang or burn" the whole party; but the
  old shepherd, to save himself, reveals that she is not his daughter, and
  produces "the mantle of gold" in which he had found her:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"He likewise produced the mantle of gold.</p>
      <p>The king was amazed the sight to behold;</p>
      <p>Though long time the shepherd had used the same,</p>
      <p>The king knew it marked with his own name."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This discovery leads directly to the unwinding of the plot: the young
  prince makes himself known, and his father being sent for, the lovers are
  <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"></a>{3}</span>
  "married in triumph" in Bohemia, and the old shepherd is made "a lord of
  the court."</p>

  <p>If any of your readers can inform me of another copy of the above
  ballad, especially unmodernised (the versification must have suffered in
  the frequent reprints) and in black-letter of an early date, they will do
  me a favour. At present I am unable to decide whether it was founded upon
  Greene's novel, Shakspeare's play, or upon some independent, possibly
  foreign, narrative. I am by no means satisfied that Greene's novel was
  not a translation, and we know that he was skilful in Italian, Spanish,
  and French.</p>

  <p class="author">J. PAYNE COLLIER.</p>

  <p>I cannot find the particular Number of NOTES AND QUERIES, but unless I
  am greatly mistaken, in one of them, a correspondent gave praise (I am
  the last to say it was not deserved) to DR. MAGINN for suggesting that
  <i>miching mallecho</i>, in <i>Hamlet</i>, Act III. Sc. 2., was from the
  Spanish <i>mucho malhecho</i>. I never heard of DR. MAGINN's opinion
  until I saw it in your pages; but if you happen to be able to refer to
  the Shakspeare I superintended through the press in 1843, vol. vii. p
  271., note 9., you will see that I propose the Spanish word
  <i>malhecho</i> as the origin of "mallecho." I did not think this point
  worth notice at the time, and I doubt whether it is worth notice now. If
  you leave out this postscript, as you are at perfect liberty to do, I
  shall conclude that you are of my opinion.</p>

  <p class="author">J.P.C.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The passage to which our valued correspondent refers is in our Second
  Volume, p. 358., where J.M.B. points out that the suggestion of a writer
  in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for March 1850, that Shakspeare's
  <i>miching mallecho</i> was a mere misprint of the Spanish words <i>mucho
  malhecho</i>, had been anticipated by DR. MAGINN. It now appears that he
  had also been anticipated by MR. COLLIER.]</p>

<h3>CROSSING RIVERS ON SKINS.</h3>

  <p>The mode of crossing a river on skins, mentioned by Layard (<i>Nineveh
  and its Remains</i>, 5th edition, vol. i. p. 129., vol. ii. p. 381.) is
  also referred to in the works of the following ancient writers. I quote
  <i>Facciolati Lexicon Totius Latinitatis</i>, in vocibus <i>Uter</i> et
  <i>Utricularius</i>. [Edit. <i>Furlanetto</i>, 4to.]</p>

  <p>"Frequens fuit apud veteres utrium usus ad flumina trananda,
  <i>Liv.</i> 21. 27. Hispani, sine ulla mole, in utres vestimentis
  conjectis, ipsi cetris suppositis incubantes, flumen tranavere,
  <i>Cæs.</i> B.G. i. 48. Lusitani, peritique earum regionum cetrati
  citerioris Hispaniæ, consectabantur, quibus erat proclive transnare
  flumen, quod consuetudo eorum omnium est, ut sine utribus ad exercitum
  non eant, (Cf. <i>Herzog.</i>, qui longam huic loco adnotationem
  adscripsit), <i>Curt.</i> 7. 5. Utres quam plurimos stramentis refertos
  dividit; his incubantes transnavere amnem, <i>Plin.</i> 6. 29. 35. Arabes
  Ascitæ appellati, quoniam bubulos utres binos sternentes ponte piraticam

  Adde <i>Front. Strat.</i> 3. 13., et <i>Ammian.</i> 30. 1.
  <i>med.</i>"</p>

  <p>"Utricularii vocabantur qui utriculos, seu utres inflatos ratibus ita
  subjiciebant, ut iisdem flumina transnare possent. Eorum collegium in
  quibusdam urbibus ad flumen aliquod sitis habebatur, ideoque utricularii
  sæpe cum nautis conjunguntur, <i>Inscr.</i> ap. <i>Mur.</i> 531, n. 4. Ex

<h3>FOLK LORE OF SOUTH NORTHAMPTONSHIRE, NO. 3.</h3>

  <p><i>Hedgehog.</i>&mdash;Among other animals looked upon in a
  superstitious light, we have the hedgehog, who, in addition to his still
  credited attribute of sucking cows, is looked upon by our rustics as the
  emblem of craft and cunning; playing the same part in our popular stories
  as Reynard in the more southern <i>fabliaux</i>. They tell concerning
  him, the legend given by M.M. Grimm, of the race between the Hare and
  Hedgehog. The Northamptonshire version makes the trial of speed between a
  <i>fox</i> and hedgehog. In all other respects the English tale runs word
  for word with the German.</p>

  <p><i>Hares.</i>&mdash;Besides the ancient superstition attached to the
  crossing of the path by one of these animals, there is also a belief that
  the running of one along the street or mainway of a village, portends
  fire to some house in the immediate vicinity.</p>

  <p><i>Toads.</i>&mdash;Belief in their venomous nature is yet far from
  being extinct. This, added to the ill-defined species of fascination
  which they are supposed to exercise, has caused them here, as elsewhere,
  to be held in great abhorrence. I have heard persons who ought to have
  known better, exclaim on the danger of gazing upon one of the harmless
  reptiles. The idea respecting the fascinating powers of the toad, is by
  no means confined to our district. Witness the learned Cardan:</p>

  <p>"Fascinari pueros fixo intuitu magnorum bufonum et maximè qui è
  subterraneo specu aut sepulchris prodierint, utque ob id occulto morbo
  perire, haud absurdum est."&mdash;<i>De Rerum Varietate</i>, lib. xvi. c.
  90.</p>

  <p><i>Crickets</i>, contrary to the idea prevailing in the western
  counties, are supposed to presage good luck, and are therefore most
  carefully preserved. Their presence is believed to be a sure omen of
  prosperity; while, on the other hand, their sudden departure from a
  hearth which has long echoed with their cry, betokens approaching
  misfortune, and is regarded as the direst calamity that can happen to the
  family.</p>

  <p><i>Magpies.</i>&mdash;To see one magpie alone bodes bad luck; two,
  good luck; three, a "berrin;" four, a wedding. This is our version of the
  saying: Grose gives it differently.</p>

  <p><i>Spiders.</i>&mdash;When a spider is found upon your <!-- Page 4
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>{4}</span> clothes, or about
  your person, it signifies that you will shortly receive some money. Old
  Fuller, who was a native of Northamptonshire, thus quaintly moralises
  this superstition:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"When a spider is found upon our clothes, we use to say, some money is
  coming towards us. The moral is this: such who imitate the industry of
  that contemptible creature may, by God's blessing, weave themselves into
  wealth and procure a plentiful estate."&mdash;<i>Worthies</i>, p.58. Pt.
  2. ed. 1662.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Omens of death and misfortune are also drawn from the howling of
  dogs&mdash;the sight of a trio of butterflies&mdash;the flying down the
  chimney of swallows or jackdaws; and swine are sometimes said to give
  their master warning of his death by giving utterance to a peculiar
  whine, known and understood only by the initiated in such matters. Gaule,
  in his <i>Mag-astromancers Posed and Puzzled</i>, Lond. 1652, p. 181,
  ranks among evil omens "the falling of swallows down the chimney" and
  "the grunting of swine."</p>

<h2>QUERIES.</h2>

<h3><i>HISTORIE DES SÉVARAMBES.</i></h3>

  <p>The authorship of <i>Gaudentio di Lucca</i> has recently been
  discussed by some of your correspondents, and it has been shown that this
  <i>Voyage Imaginaire</i> <!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page5"></a>{5}</span> was written by Simon Berington, a Catholic
  priest, and the member of a family resident for many years in
  Herefordshire. The following Query will relate to another work of the
  same class, but of an earlier date.</p>

  <p>The <i>Histoire des Sévarambes</i> is a fictitious account of a nation
  in the Southern Ocean, visited by a supposed navigator named Siden. It's
  first appearance was as an English work, with this title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The History of the Sevarites or Sevarambi, a nation inhabiting part
  of the third continent, commonly called Terræ Australes Incognitæ; with
  an account of their admirable government, religion, customs, and
  language. Written by one Captain Siden, a worthy person, who, together
  with many others, was cast upon those coasts, and lived many years in
  that country. London: printed for Henry Brome, at the Gun, at the west
  end of St. Paul's Churchyard, 1675. 12mo. pp. 114." No preface.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a second part, "more wonderful and delightful than the
  first," published in 1679 (pp. 140.). The licence by Roger Lestrange
  bears date Feb. 25. 1678/9. There is a short preface, without signature,
  arguing that the country of the Sevarites is not fabulous.</p>

  <p>A copy of the original edition of these two parts is in the British
  Museum.</p>

  <p>Shortly after its publication in England, this work appeared in France
  with the following title:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Histoire des Sévarambes, peuples qui habitent une partie du troisième
  continent ordinairement appellé Terre Australe, contenant un compte exact
  du gouvernement, des m&#339;urs, de la réligion et du langage de cette
  nation, jusques aujourd'hui inconnue aux peuples de l'Europe. Traduite de
  l'Anglois." First Part, Paris, 1677. 2 vols. 12mo. Second Part, 1678-9. 3
  vols. 12mo.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Both parts are dedicated to Monsieur Riquet, Baron de Bonrepos; and
  the dedications are both signed with the initials D.V.D.E.L.</p>

  <p>The British Museum contains no French edition of this work earlier
  than an Amsterdam reprint of 1716. The above account of the early French
  edition is taken from the <i>Dictionnaire Historique</i> of Prosper
  Marchand (La Haye, 1758), tom. i. p. 11., art. ALLAIS. This article
  (which may be cited as a model of bibliographical research) attributes
  the authorship of the <i>Histoire des Sévarambes</i>, upon evidence,
  which, if not conclusive, is very strong, to Denis Vairasse, or Vayrasse.
  Marchand explains the initials appended to the dedications of the French
  edition to mean, <i>Denis Vairasse d'Allais en Languedoc</i>. He likewise
  considers <i>Siden</i> as the anagram of <i>Denis</i>; and
  <i>Sevarias</i>, the legislator of the Sevarambians, as the anagram of
  <i>Vairasse</i>. Some of the religious opinions expressed in this fiction
  were thought bold, and the authorship of the work was at one time much
  discussed: it was attributed both to Isaac Vossius and Leibnitz. It was
  translated into Dutch, German, and Italian; and there is an English
  edition, London, 1738, in 1 vol. 8vo., in which the preface from the
  French edition, alluding to Plato's <i>Republic</i>, More's
  <i>Utopia</i>, and Bacon's <i>New Atlantis</i>, not to be found in the
  original English edition, is introduced. This volume is
  entitled&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The History of the Sevarambians, a people of the south continent, in
  five parts, containing, &amp;c. Translated from the Memoirs of Capt.
  Siden, who lived fifteen years amongst them."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The work is included in the collection of <i>Voyages Imaginaires</i>,
  tom. v., where the editor speaks of the distinguished place which it
  holds among the fictions of that class; but he says that its authorship
  was unknown or uncertain. An account of another fictitious voyage to the
  Terra Australis, with a description of an imaginary people, published in
  1692, may be seen in Bayle's <i>Dict.</i>, art. SADEUR, <i>Voyages
  Imaginaires</i>, tom. xxiv.</p>

  <p>According to the account given by Marchand, Vairasse began life by
  serving in the army in Piedmont, and he afterwards studied the law.
  Subsequently he went to England, where he is stated to have attempted to
  penetrate the intrigues of the court, and to discover the maxims of the
  English Government. In 1665, he was in the ship commanded by the Duke of
  York against the Dutch; and some years afterwards, having been regarded
  as an accomplice in the designs of a public minister (apparently Lord
  Clarendon), he was forced to retire with him, and follow him to Paris. He
  re-entered the military service, and was with the French army which
  invaded Holland in 1672. Afterwards he taught English and French at
  Paris; he likewise published a French Grammar, and an abridgment of it in
  the English language (1683). He was of the reformed religion.</p>

  <p>It is possible that Vairasse's visit to England may have been
  connected with his religion. He appears, during his residence here, to
  have acquired the English language; but it is difficult to understand
  what are the designs of Lord Clarendon in which he was an "accomplice."
  Lord Clarendon's exile took place in 1667; which hardly accords with the
  expression "some years" after 1665. No person of the name of Vairasse is
  mentioned as having accompanied Lord Clarendon in his banishment.</p>

  <p>The first part of the <i>History of the Sevarambians</i> was published
  in English in 1675, two years before the French edition of the first
  part. The second parts were published at London and Paris in the same
  year. Even if Vairasse did not leave England with Lord Clarendon, he had
  left it before the year in which the first part of this <!-- Page 6
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span> work appeared in
  English: for he is stated to have been with the French army in Holland in
  1672. It is therefore difficult to account for the publication of the
  English version of the <i>History of the Sevarambians</i> before its
  publication in France, upon the assumption that Vairasse was the author.
  The writer of the life of Vairasse (art. ALLAIS) in the <i>Biographical
  Dictionary of the Society of Useful Knowledge</i> thinks that he may have
  been only the translator: but the facts collected by Marchand show that
  he claimed the authorship; and there is no trace of its composition by
  any Englishman. Besides, its prior publication in England is just as
  inexplicable upon the assumption of his being the translator, as upon
  that of his being the author.</p>

  <p>Query, Is Vairasse's residence in England mentioned by any English
  writer? And can any light be thrown upon the authorship of the <i>History
  of the Sevarambians</i> from any English source?</p>

<h3>ORIGINS OF PRESENT PENNY POSTAGE.</h3>

  <p>Many of your readers have, I doubt not, perused with interest the
  vivid sketch of the origin of the Penny Postage System, given by Miss
  Martineau in her <i>History of England during the Thirty Years'
  Peace</i>, vol. ii. p. 425., and have seen in the incident of the
  shilling letter delivered to the poor cottager, somewhere in the Lake
  district&mdash;refused by her from professed inability to pay the
  postage&mdash;paid for by Mr. Rowland Hill, who happened most opportunely
  to be passing that way&mdash;and, when opened, found to be blank (this
  plan being preconcerted between the woman and her correspondent, to know
  of each other's welfare without the expense of postage). A remarkable
  instance of "how great events from little causes spring," and have
  bestowed much admiration on the penetration of Mr. Hill's mind, which
  "wakened up at once to a significance of the fact," nor ever rested till
  he had devised and effected his scheme of Post-office Reform; though all
  the while an uncomfortable feeling might be lurking behind as to the
  perfect credibility of so interesting a mode of accounting for the
  initiation of this great social benefit.</p>

  <p>I confess to having had some suspicions myself as to the
  trustworthiness of this story; and a few days since my suspicions were
  fully confirmed by discovering that the real hero of the tale was not the
  Post-office Reformer, but the poet Coleridge; unless, indeed, which is
  surely out of the range of ordinary probabilities, the same event,
  <i>corresponding exactly as to place and amount of postage</i>, happened
  to two persons at separate times.</p>

  <p>Coleridge relates the story himself, in one of his "conversations," of
  which memoranda are preserved in the interesting volumes published by
  Moxon in 1836 (ii. 114.). "One day,"</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"when I had not a shilling to spare, I was passing by a cottage at
  <i>Keswick</i> where a carter was demanding <i>a shilling</i> for a
  letter, which the woman of the house appeared unwilling to give, and at
  last declined to take. I paid the postage, and when the man was out of
  sight, she told me that the letter was from her son, who took that means
  of letting her know that he was well. The letter was not to be paid for.
  It was then opened and <i>found to be blank</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now, while so many copies of "NOTES AND QUERIES" pass through the
  Post-office, it is to be hoped one at least may remain there, and be the
  means of inducing Mr. Hill to inform us whether Miss Martineau had any
  authority for fathering this story upon him; and whether the Post-office
  Reform is really indebted to any such trivial incident for its original
  idea.</p>

<h3>RED BOOK OF THE IRISH EXCHEQUER.</h3>

  <p>On one of the vellum leaves of which the Red Book of the Irish
  Exchequer is composed, there is depicted a pen and ink sketch of that
  court. In the centre of the picture is the table, which is covered (as it
  is at this day) with a chequered cloth, whereon are placed a bag upon
  which are the words "Baga cum rotulis," a book with a clasp, five large
  pieces of money, and a strip of parchment, upon which is written, "Ceo
  vous, &amp;c." The table is surrounded on its four equal sides by
  thirteen human figures, namely, six at the top of the picture, three on
  the left hand, three on the right, and one at the bottom. Of the six
  figures at the top of the sketch, all of whom wear robes, he who is on
  the right hand holds a wand, bears upon his head a cap, and is in the act
  of leaving the court, exclaiming, "Ademayn." To the right of this man,
  who is probably the crier of the court, is one of the officers carrying a
  piece of parchment, upon which is written in contracted law Latin,
  "Preceptum fuit Vicecomiti per breve hujus Scaccarii." To the right of
  the last-named figure is another officer of the court, who is in the act
  of examining his pen by placing its nib at a short distance from his
  eyes; and this person carries in his left hand a piece of parchment upon
  which are written, in like character, the words "Memorandum quod x die
  Maii, &amp;c." To the right of this officer, who is probably the Chief
  Remembrancer, is placed another officer, wearing a cap, who is in the act
  of writing upon a piece of parchment bearing the words "Henricus dei
  gratia." The two remaining figures at the top of the picture are
  apparently conversing together: to one of them are applied the words,
  "Eynt bre vic.," with another word following the last which <!-- Page 7
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span> is scarcely
  decypherable; and to the other the word "Elgyn" seems to have reference;
  such word being placed upon the ample sleeve of his gown. The three
  figures on the left of the picture are probably the three Barons. The
  head-dress of the judge who is sitting at the extreme right of the bench,
  varies in its form from that which is worn by the baron who is seated in
  the centre; and the third baron, who is sitting at the left, has his head
  uncovered. The first-named baron seems in the act of counting or
  reckoning the pieces of coin which are placed before him upon the table,
  and says "xx d.;" the baron in the centre, who wears a cap similar in
  form to the night-cap now commonly used, says "Voyr dire;" and the third
  baron says "Soient forfez." Opposite to the judges, and to the right of
  the picture, are three persons wearing gowns, and standing at the bar of
  the court. One of these points towards his face with the first finger of
  his right hand, and says, "Oy de brie;" the figure to his left extends
  his right arm towards the bench, and exclaims, "Soit oughte;" and the
  third figure says, "Chalange." This man, the handle of whose sword is
  distinctly visible on his right side, whose outer sleeves are wide and
  flowing, whose under garment is buttoned tightly at the wrist, and whose
  boots are in shape similar to ladies' boots of modern times, closely
  laced to the leg, has placed the thumb of his left hand between the thumb
  and first finger of his right. And, lastly, at the bottom of the picture
  is seated the sheriff, bearing upon his head a hood or cap, upon which
  the words "Vic. tot &amp; unit" are written. Query, Are the persons here
  represented the barons and officers of the Exchequer? and, more
  especially, who are the persons who exclaim "Oy de brie," "Soit oughte,"
  and "Chalange"?</p>

  <p><i>Cranmer's Descendants.</i>&mdash;Being much interested in
  everything that concerns the martyrs of the Reformation, and not the less
  so from being descended (in the female line) from the father of
  Archbishop Cranmer, I should be very glad if any of your correspondents
  could inform me whether there are any of his male descendants still in
  existence. Gilpin, in his <i>Lives of the Reformers</i>, says that the
  Archbishop's wife and children lived in great obscurity. This was
  probably on account of the prejudice, which had hardly passed away,

  send you a specimen which I do not remember to have seen in print. It was
  occasioned by the Pope Pius VI. (Braschi) having placed his own coat of

<h2>REPLIES.</h2>

<h3>"GOD SPEED THE PLOUGH."</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. i., p. 230.)</p>

  <p>L.S. asks, in what rebellion was the banner carried with the motto
  "God speed the plough?"&mdash;(<i>Homily against Wilful
  Rebellion.</i>)</p>

  <p>Probably in the rebellion of the Earls of Northumberland and
  Westmoreland in the north of England, during the autumn of A.D. 1569. In
  the passage of the homily which immediately follows the one quoted by
  L.S., occur these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"And though some rebels bear the picture of the five wounds painted,
  against those who put their only hope of salvation in the wounds of
  Christ ... and though they do bear the image of the cross painted in a
  rag ... yet let no good and godly subject ... follow such
  standard-bearers of rebellion."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again: just <i>before</i> the quotation cited by L.S. <!-- Page 9
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>{9}</span> is an allusion to
  the "defacing or deformation" which the rebels have made, "where through
  they tarry but a little while they make such reformation, that they
  destroy all places, and undo all men where they come."</p>

  <p>Collier, in his <i>Eccles. History</i>, vol. vi. p. 469. edit.
  Straker, 1840, part ii. b. vi., says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"However, the insurrection went on, and the rebels made their first
  march to Durham. And here going into the churches <i>they tore the
  English Bible</i> and the <i>Common Prayer</i>. They officiated in the
  service of the mass, <i>had the five wounds of Christ represented in some
  of their colours</i>, and a chalice in others. One Richard Norton, an
  ancient gentleman, carried the standard <i>with a cross in it</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In this passage we have three out of four facts enumerated: 1st. The
  defacing of places; 2d. The banner with the five wounds; 3d. The standard
  with the cross. It does not, therefore, seem unreasonable to infer, that
  the other fact alluded to, viz. the banner with the motto, is to be
  referred to the same rebellion.</p>

  <p>It is not, however, impossible that the rebellion, which broke out
  A.D. 1549, first in the western counties, and then in Oxfordshire, Bucks,
  Norfolk, Suffolk, and Yorkshire, may be also alluded to in the homily.
  For Cranmer, in his answer to the Devonshire and Cornish rebels, urges
  this amongst other reasons:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Fourthly, for that they let the harvest, which is the chief
  sustentation of our life; and God of his goodness hath sent it
  abundantly. And they by their folly do cause it to be lost and
  abandoned."&mdash;Strype's <i>Mem. of C.</i>, ed. Oxf. 1840, vol. ii. p.
  841.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>An argument similar to the one used in the homily.</p>

  <p>The insurrection, in fact, in the midland and north-eastern counties,
  began with an attempt to redress an agricultural grievance; according to
  Fox (<i>E.H.</i> vol. ii. p. 665. edit. 1641); "about plucking down of
  enclosures and enlarging of commons." The date of the homily itself
  offers no objection; for though it is said (Oxf. ed. Pref. p. v.) not to
  occur in any collected edition printed before 1571, yet there exists a
  separate edition of it printed in 4to. by Jugge and Cawood, probably
  <i>earlier</i> than A.D. 1563. Collier does not quote his authority for
  the statement about the banners, but probably it was either Camden or
  Holinshed, and a reference to these authors, which I regret I have no
  means of making, might established the particular point in question.</p>

<h3>"DEFENDER OF THE FAITH."</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">(Vol. ii., pp. 442. 481.)</p>

  <p>I regret that my Note, inserted in your paper of Nov. 30th, was so
  ambiguously written as to elicit such a reply as it has been favoured
  with by MR. GIBSON of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</p>

  <p>What I meant to say in my last Note was simply this&mdash;that two
  persons, viz. Messrs. Christopher Wren and Chamberlayne, have asserted
  that the title "Defender of the Faith" had been used by our monarchs
  anterior to 1521; and in support of their assertions, cite the Black Book
  of the order of the garter, and several charters granted to the
  University of Oxford: that is, each gives a distinct proof of his
  allegation.</p>

  <p>Had MR. GIBSON understood my Note, as I trust he now will, he will see
  at once that the expression "untrue" is totally inapplicable to their
  statements, at least upon any showing upon his part; for he does not
  appear to me to have consulted either the Black Book or the charters, on
  which alone their assertions are based, to which alone we must in common
  honesty refer, and by which alone their veracity must be judged.</p>

  <p>That their "startling" statements do not appear in Selden, nor in
  Luder's brief paper in the 19th vol. of the <i>Archæologia</i>, is
  conceded; but I think it might have occurred to the mind of one of less
  acumen than MR. GIBSON, that it was precisely because the allegations do
  not appear in these or any other writers or authorities that I considered
  them not unworthy of the attention of the readers of the "NOTES AND
  QUERIES". I am at a loss to reconcile MR. GIBSON'S expression
  "startling," as applied to the assertions of Messrs. Wren and
  Chamberlayne (and I need not add, that had they not been startling to
  myself as to him, they would never have found their way to your paper),
  with the following paragraph:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In this sense, the sovereign and every knight became a sworn defender
  of the faith. Can this duty have come to be popularly attributed as part
  of the royal style and title?"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I do not allude to this statement in a critical point of view, but
  simply, as, from the general tenor of his communication, MR. GIBSON
  appears to labour under an impression, that, from ignorance of historical
  authorities, I have merely given utterance to a <i>popular</i> fallacy,
  unheard of by him and other learned men; and, like the "curfew," to be
  found in no contemporaneous writer. I beg, however, to assure him, that
  before forwarding the note and question to your paper, I had examined not
  only the Bulls, and our best historians, but also the works of such
  writers as Prynne, Lord Herbert, Spelman, Camdem, and others, who have in
  any way treated of regal titles and prerogatives.</p>

  <p>I have only to add, that beyond the investigation of the truth of the
  assertions of Messrs. Wren and Chamberlayne, I am not in any way
  interested. I care not for the result. I only seek for the elucidation of
  that which is at once "startling" and a "popular fallacy".</p>

<h3>BEATRIX LADY TALBOT.</h3>

  <p>In reference to the Query of SCOTUS (Vol. ii., p 478.) respecting
  Beatrix Lady Talbot (so long confounded by genealogists with her more
  illustrious contemporary, Beatrix Countess of Arundel), perhaps I may be
  permitted to state, that the merit, whatever it may be, of having been
  the first to discover this error, belongs to myself; and that the whole
  of the facts and authorities to prove the non-identity of the two ladies
  were supplied by me to the late Sir H. Nicolas, to enable him to compile
  the article on the subject in the <i>Collectanea Topographica</i>, vol.
  i.; the notes to which also were almost entirely written by myself. From
  the note of SCOTUS, one would suppose that <i>he</i> had made the
  discovery that Lady Talbot belonged to the Portuguese family of
  <i>Pinto</i>; whereas he merely transcribes my words in p. 405. of the
  Addenda to vol. i. of the <i>Collectanea</i>.</p>

  <p>I had originally supposed that this lady was a member of the house of
  <i>Sousa</i>, which bore a coat of four crescents, quartered with the
  arms of Portugal (without the border); and in that belief a paragraph was
  written by Sir H. Nicolas, accompanied by a pedigree, to show the
  connexion of Beatrix Lady Talbot, through her great-great-grandfather,
  with the royal line of Portugal, and, consequently, with Beatrix Countess
  of Arundel; but these were subsequently struck out. By an oversight,
  however, the note referring to some works on the genealogy of the house
  of Sousa has been allowed to remain at p. 87. of the <i>Collectanea</i>;
  and as it stands at present, it has no corresponding passage in the text.
  For the information that Lady Talbot bore the arms of Pinto, I was really
  indebted to a Portuguese gentleman, the Chevalier M.T. de Moraes
  Sarmento, who published (anonymously) a small volume entitled <i>Russell
  de Albuquerque, Conto Moral, por um Portuguez</i>, 12mo. Cintra, 1833, at
  p. 331-2. of which work is a brief notice of the two Beatrixes, from
  memoranda furnished by myself. At the time I collected the information
  given to Sir H. Nicolas, I wrote to the Earl of Shrewsbury, to inquire
  whether among the family papers any evidence could be found, to clear up
  the history of his ancestress; but his lordship informed me he had no
  means of elucidating the difficulty, and that in the earliest pedigree in
  his possession (drawn up in the reign of Elizabeth), Beatrix Lady Talbot
  was not only described as daughter of the King of Portugal, but had the
  royal arms of Portugal assigned to her,&mdash;a proof, by the way, that
  even in pedigrees compiled and attested by heralds, there are statements
  which are not borne out by historic documents. I am still, therefore,
  like SCOTUS, anxious to know more about this lady, and hope some of your
  correspondents versed in Portuguese genealogies may supply the required
  information.</p>

<h3>REPLIES TO MINOR QUERIES.</h3>

  <p><i>Passage in Hamlet</i> (Vol. ii., p.494.).&mdash;The word
  <i>modern</i>, instead of <i>moderate</i>, in my editions of Shakspeare,
  is a printer's error, which shall be corrected in the edition I am now
  publishing. To a person unfamiliar with printing, it might appear
  impossible that any compositor, with this copy before him,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>should substitute&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"While one with modern haste might tell a hundred."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And yet such substitution of one word for another is a constant
  anxiety to every editor. Some may consider that a competent editor would
  detect such a gross blunder. Unfortunately, the more familiar the mind is
  with the correct reading, the more likely is such an error to escape the
  eye. Your correspondent who did me the favour to point out this blunder
  will, I trust, receive this explanation, as also your other readers, in a
  candid spirit. The error has run through three editions, from the
  circumstance that the first edition furnished the copy for the subsequent
  ones. The passage in question was not a doubtful text, and therefore
  required no special editorial attention. The typographical blunder is,
  however, an illustration of the difficulties which beset the editors of
  our old dramatists especially. Had the word <i>modern</i> occurred in an
  early edition of Shakspeare, it would have perplexed very commentator;
  but few would have ventured to substitute the correct word,
  <i>moderate</i>. The difficulty lies in finding the just mean between
  timidity and rashness. With regard to typographical errors, the obvious
  ones naturally supply their own correction; but in the instance before
  us, as in many others, it is not easy to detect the substitution, and the
  blunder is perpetuated. If a compositor puts <i>one</i> for
  <i>won</i>&mdash;a very common blunder&mdash;the context will show that
  the ear has misled the eye; but if he change an epithet in a well-known
  passage, the first syllable of the right and the wrong words being the
  same, and the violation of the propriety not very startling, the best
  diligence may pass over the mistake. It must not be forgotten that many
  gross errors in typography occur after the sheet is gone to press,
  through the accidents that are constantly happening to the movable
  types.</p>

  <p><i>Passage in Tennyson</i> (Vol. ii., p. 479.)&mdash;The following
  extract from Sir James Mackintosh's <i>History of England</i> vol. ii. p.
  185., will explain this passage:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The love of Margaret Roper continued to display itself in those
  outwardly unavailing tokens of tenderness to his (her father, Sir Thomas
  More's) remains, by which affection seeks to perpetuate itself;
  ineffectually, indeed, for the object, but very effectually for <!-- Page
  11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>{11}</span> softening
  the heart and exalting the soul. She procured his head be taken down from
  London Bridge, where more odious passions had struggled in pursuit of a
  species of infernal immortality by placing it. She kept it during her
  life as a sacred relic, and was buried with that object of fondness in
  her arms, nine years after she was separated from her father."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author">X.Z.</p>

  <p><i>Was Quarles pensioned?</i> (Vol. i., p. 201.).&mdash;I believe that
  no reply has been made to this Query. The following passage, transcribed
  from the <i>Epistle Dedicatory</i> to the surreptitious edition of
  Quarles's <i>Judgment and Mercy</i>, affords a slight negative proof to
  the contrary;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"And being so usefull, dare not doubt your patronage of this
  <i>child</i>, which survives a <i>father</i>, whose utmost abilities were
  (till death darkned that great light in his soule) sacrificed to your
  service."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Now if Charles had conferred a pension on Quarles, is it not
  exceedingly probable that the publisher and dedicator, Richard Royston,
  would have recalled so honourable a circumstance to the memory of his
  "Most gratious soveraigne King Charles" in this <i>Epistle
  Dedicatory</i>, when he had so excellent an opportunity of doing so?</p>

  &amp;c. I do not remember the words, but they were gross: the chief
  <i>fun</i> seemed to consist in the chorus,&mdash;a sort of
  <i>burring</i> noise being made with the lips, while the doubled fists
  were rubbed and thumped upon the thigh, as if the cobbler's lapstone had

  the oldest son of Sir John Tempest, Bart., of Tong Hall, by Henrietta his
  wife, daughter and heir of Sir Henry Cholmley of Newton Grange, married
  Alathea, daughter of Sir Henry Thompson of Marston, county of York, and
  had two daughters, Alathea and Henrietta; one of these ladies was
  celebrated as Pope's Daphne. Henry Tempest died very young, before his
  father Sir John; the next brother, George, succeeded to the title and
  Tong estates. Daphne was on the point of being, married very highly,
  tradition says to the Duke of Wharton, but died of the small-pox before
  the celebration.</p>

  <p><i>Scandal against Queen Elizabeth</i> (Vol. ii., p.
  393.).&mdash;Although many of your correspondents must be well able to
  reply to P.T.'s Query, I have seen no notice of it as yet. The note to
  Burton's <i>Diary</i>, in citing Osborn, ought to have begun with the
  word which precedes the words quoted. The note would then have run
  thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"That Queen Elizabeth had a son, &amp;c., I neglect to insert, as
  fitter for a romance than to mingle with so much truth and integrity as I
  profess."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the Add. MSS. 5524. is an apparently modern note, stated to be in
  the handwriting of Mr. Ives, to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"I have heard it confidently asserted, that Queen Elizabeth was with
  child by the Earl of Essex, and that she was delivered of a child at
  Kenilworth Castle, which died soon after its birth, was interred at
  Kenilworth, and had a stone put over it, inscribed
  '<i>Silentium</i>.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This is doubtless one of the many tales, which, as Osborn says, "may
  be found in the black relations of the Jesuits, and some French and
  Spanish Pasquilers." These slanderers were chiefly, I believe, Parsons or
  Persons, and Sanders, who scrupled at nothing that would tend to blacken
  the character and reputation of Elizabeth. Thus besides the above, and
  other stories of Elizabeth <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span> herself, it was stated by Sanders that her
  mother, Anne Boleyn, was Henry VIII.'s own daughter; and that he
  intrigued, not only with Anne's mother, but with her sister. P.T. will
  find these points, and others which are hardly suited for public
  discussion, noticed in the article on ELIZABETH in Bayle's
  <i>Dictionary</i>.</p>

  <p class="author">CUDYN GWYN.</p>

  <p><i>Church of St. Saviour, Canterbury</i> (Vol. ii., p. 478.).&mdash;I
  would submit to Sir Henry Ellis, that the church at Canterbury which is
  mentioned in the charter from which he quotes, is termed <i>Mater et
  Domina</i>, not on account of its greater antiquity, but by reason of its
  superior dignity; and that the church referred to is clearly the
  cathedral church. The charter is one of confirmation of privileges: it
  proceeded upon the "admonition of the most pious Archbishop Liuingus,"
  and "upon consideration of the liberties <i>of the monasteries</i>
  situated within Kent." It granted that the church of the Saviour
  (<i>ecclesia Salvatoris</i>), situated in Canterbury, the mother and lady
  of all the churches in the kingdom of England, should be free, and that
  no one should have any right therein <i>save the archbishop and the monks
  there serving God</i>. The whole tenor of the charter, and more
  particularly the words last referred to, "archiepiscopum et monachos
  ibidem deo famulantes," seem to me to indicate the cathedral church, and
  no other. If it be inquired, How then came it to pass that the cathedral,
  which is dedicated to Christ, should be described as <i>ecclesia
  Salvatoris?</i> some persons may answer, that this apparent blunder is an
  indication that the charter is not genuine. But that is not my opinion.
  The charter is printed from the register of the cathedral, and if it had
  been forged by the monks, they would scarcely have made a mistake upon
  such a point as the dedication of their own church. Coming out of such
  custody, the unusual designation, as we now esteem it, seems clear proof
  that the charter is genuine. I would suggest, either that the cathedral,
  or a part of it, was really dedicated to the Saviour; or that the words
  are to be understood not as indicating the church of St. Saviour, but the
  church of the Saviour, that is, Christ.</p>

  inquiry of CEPHAS, I give you the following anecdote, in the words of the
  Rev. Dr. Kirk, of Lichfield, who still survives (and long may he yet
  survive!) to bear testimony to its correctness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"Charles Plowden travelled with Mr. Middleton; and when at Rome, he
  called with Mr. Thorpe to see me at the English college. We walked
  together for some time in St. George's Hall, and he quite scandalised me
  with the manner in which he spoke of Ganganelli. There is no doubt that
  Mr. Plowden had a principal hand in the <i>Life of Ganganelli</i>, which
  was published in London in 1785. Father Thorpe supplied the materials
  (J.T. is subscribed to the letters printed), and Mr. Plowden arranged
  them. I brought a packet of letters from Mr. Thorpe to Mr. C. Plowden,
  and one or two other packets were brought from him to Mr. Plowden by
  other students. 'The contents were so scandalous,' said Bishop Milner in
  my hearing, at Oscott, 'that Mr. Weld, with whom Mr. C. Plowden lived,
  insisted on the work being suppressed.' The copies were all bought up,
  and I have never seen or heard of a copy since I saw it in Coghlan's shop
  in 1785. Mr. Cordell, of Newcastle, wrote some observations upon it. Mr.
  Conolly, S.J., told me at Oxford, October 17, 1814, that he 'once saw in
  a corner of Mr. C. Plowden's room, a heap of papers, some torn, and put
  there apparently to be burnt. I took up one of them,' he said, 'which was
  torn in two.' It contained anecdotes and observations <i>against
  Ganganelli</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was doubtless from this collection that Mr. Keon was supplied with
  those papers, which he published in <i>Dolman's Magazine</i> in 1846,
  concerning "The Preservation of the Society of Jesus in the Empire of
  Russia."</p>

  <p><i>Pope Ganganelli</i> (Vol. ii., p. 464.).&mdash;The Rev. Charles
  Cordell, a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, who was stationed at
  Newcastle-upon-Tyne about the date mentioned by your correspondent CEPHAS
  (he was there in 1787), was the translator of the letters of Pope Clement
  XIV. (Ganganelli); but as I have not the book, I do not know whether it
  contained also a life of that pontiff. Mr. Cordell was editor of other
  works.</p>

  <p><i>Nicholas Ferrar's Digest</i> (Vol. ii., p.446.).&mdash;One of the
  copies of the Gidding <i>Digest of the History of our Saviour's Life</i>,
  inquired after by J.H.M. (a most beautiful book), is in the library of
  the Marquis of Salisbury. I believe it to be the copy presented to
  Charles I.</p>

  <p class="author">W.H.C.</p>

  <p><i>Ferrar, Nicholas.</i>&mdash;The following extract from a very
  interesting paper on "Illustrated Books" in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
  vol. lxxiv. p. 173, will aid J.H.M. in his researches after the curious
  volumes arranged by the members of the Ferrar family:</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"King Charles's statues, pictures, jewels, and curiosities, were sold
  and dispersed by the regicide powers; from this fate, happily, the royal
  collection of manuscripts and books was preserved; neither was it, like
  the archiepiscopal library at Lambeth, doled out piecemeal to Hugh Peters
  and his brother fanatics. This good service was mainly owing to Bolstrode
  Whitelocke. When the British Museum was founded, King George II.
  presented to it the whole of the royal library; and Ferrar's
  <i>Concordance</i>, with another similarly illustrated compilation by
  him, is there preserved in safety. The Rev. Thomas Bowdler of Sydenham,
  the representative of the last baronet of the Cotton family, the founders
  of the Cottonian Library, possesses another of the Ferrar volumes. Of
  those which were presented by Ferrar to George Herbert and Dr. Jackson,
  no record remains."</p>

  <p><i>Cardinal Erskine</i> (Vol. ii., p. 406.) flourished later than your
  correspondent G.W. supposes. He was in communication with Mr. Pitt about
  1799-1800. Query, was he then in England?</p>

  <p><i>The Author of Peter Wilkins</i> (Vol. ii., p. 480.).&mdash;An
  advertisement prefixed to the edition of this remarkable work in Smith's
  <i>Standard Library</i>, 1839, gives the following information respecting
  the author:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"In the year 1835, Mr. Nicol the printer sold by auction a number of
  books and manuscripts in his possession, which had formerly belonged to
  the well-known publisher Dodsley; and in arranging them for sale, the
  original agreement for the sale of the manuscript of 'Peter Wilkins,' by
  the author, 'Robert Pultock of Clement's Inn' to Dodsley, was discovered.
  From this document it appears that Mr. Pultock received twenty pounds,
  twelve copies of the work, and 'the cuts of the first impression,' that
  is, a set of proof impressions of the fanciful engravings that professed
  to illustrate the first edition, as the price of the entire copyright.
  This curious document was sold to John Wilks, Esq., M.P. on the 17th
  December, 1835."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Leigh Hunt, in his <i>Book for a Corner</i>, remarks upon
  this,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1">

  <p>"The reader will observe that the words 'by the author,' in this
  extract, are not accompanied by marks of quotation. The fact, however, is
  stated as if he knew it for such, by the quoter of the document."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The difference mentioned by DR. RIMBAULT between the initials in the
  title-page and those appended to the dedication, occurs also in Mr.
  Smith's edition. But the dedication to which the initials R.P. are
  affixed, speaks of the book as the work of the writer in the most
  unmistakeable terms. Was the S. in the place of the P. a typographical
  error, perpetuated by carelessness and oversight; or a mystification of
  the author, adopted when the success of the book was uncertain, and
  continued after the dedication had contradicted it, by that want of
  attention to minutiæ which was more frequently manifest in former times
  than at present?</p>

  <p>Mr. Leigh Hunt informs us that the Countess of Northumberland, to whom
  the dedication is made, was the lady to whom Percy addressed his
  <i>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</i>. "She was a Wriothesley descended of
  Shakspeare's Earl of Southampton, and appears to have been a very amiable
  woman."</p>

  <p>Permit me to take this opportunity of saying, that there is a misprint
  in the poem by Barry Cornwall (Vol. ii., p. 451.), by which the title of
  a poem from which a quotation is made, appears as the name of a
  <i>dramatis persona</i>. "Paris" is the title of a poem by the Rev. Geo.
  Croly, from which the "motto" is quoted.</p>

  <p class="author">G.J. DE WILDE.</p>

  <p><i>Peter Wilkins</i> (Vol. ii., p. 480.).&mdash;In the preface to a
  garbled and mutilated edition of this work, which appeared Lond. 1839,
  sq. 12mo., it is stated that the author was Robert Pultock, of Clement's
  Inn, which is in accordance with the initials to the dedication. Those of
  R.S. on the title I consider as mere fiction. Lowndes gives the 1st ed.
  1750, 2 vols. 12mo. and I have a note of a reprint, Dublin, Geo. Falkner,
  1751, 2 vols. 12mo., "illustrated with several cuts." My copy is Lond.
  1816, 2 vols. 12mo., with a few indifferent engravings.</p>

  106.</p>

  <i>Account of Privately Printed Books</i>.]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>The Widow of the Wood</i> (Vol. ii., p. 406.).&mdash;The history of
  this publication can hardly be given without raking up a piece of scandal
  affecting an honourable family still in existence. If DR. RIMBAULT wishes
  to see the book, and has any difficulty in meeting with it, I shall be
  happy to forward him my copy by the post on learning his address. I
  inclose you mine, and will thank you to communicate it to him if he
  should wish for it.</p>

  <p>The maiden name of this "widow" was Anne Northey. Her second husband
  was Sir Wm. Wolseley; her <i>fourth</i>, Mr. Hargrave, father of the
  celebrated jurist. Every copy of the work which could be found was
  destroyed by the latter gentleman.</p>

  <p class="author">H.C.</p>

  <p><i>Damasked Linen</i> (Vol. ii., p. 199.).&mdash;It may interest
  R.G.P.M. to learn that portion of the damasked linen which formed part of
  the establishment of James II. when in Ireland, still exists in the
  possession of R. Ely, Esq., of Ballaghmore Castle in the Queen's County.
  I have seen with that gentleman several large napkins beautifully
  damasked with the then royal arms, together with the initials J.R. of
  large size, and elaborately flourished. The tradition of the family is,
  that they were obtained from the plunder of James's camp equipage, after
  the defeat of the Boyne. Mr. Ely's ancestor was in William's army.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Every one who had an opportunity of inspecting the glorious assemblage
  of masterpieces of workmanship and design which were collected together
  at the <i>Exhibition of Ancient and Mediæval Art</i> last spring, must
  have felt a desire to possess some more lasting memorial of that
  unparalleled display than the mere catalogue. <!-- Page 14 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>{14}</span> So strong, indeed, was
  this feeling at the time, as to call several announcements of works in
  preparation, commemorative of the Exhibition, including one by the
  accomplished Honorary Secretary of the Committee, Mr. Franks. Mr. Franks
  has, however, we regret to hear, now abandoned that intention, so that of
  these promised memorials, we shall probably only see the one which has
  just been published under the title of <i>Choice Examples of Art
  Workmanship, selected from the Exhibition of Ancient and Mediæval Art at
  the Society of Arts</i>; and, whether as a pleasant record to those who
  visited the collection, or as a compensation for their disappointment to
  those who were not so fortunate, the book will, doubtless, find favour
  with the rapidly increasing class who take an interest in works of this
  character. That the publishers anticipate a large sale, is obvious, from
  the remarkably low price at which they have published this beautiful
  volume, which contains upwards of sixty engravings, drawn from the gems
  of the collection, by Mr. De la Motte, and engraved under his
  superintendence; and furnishes representations of objects of the most
  varied kinds, from the <i>Nautilus Cup</i> belonging to Her Majesty, to
  Mr. Vulliamy's <i>Ivory Bas-reliefs</i> ascribed to Fiamingo, Mr. Slade's
  matchless specimens of <i>Glass</i>, and Dr. Rock's
  <i>Superaltare</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Charles Knight has just put forth a small pamphlet, entitled
  <i>Case of the Authors as regards the Paper Duty</i>, in which he shows
  most ably and most clearly the social advantages which must result from
  the repeal of a tax which, as Mr. Knight proves, "encourages the
  production of inferior and injurious works by unskilled labourers in
  literature."</p>

  <p>The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> of the present month is a capital
  number. Mr. Cunningham has commenced in it, what promises to be an
  interesting series of papers upon a subject which that gentleman's
  well-known tact and judgment ill prevent from being objectionable, <i>The
  Story of Nell Gwyn</i>; and the numerous friends of the late Mr.
  Amyot&mdash;and how numerous were his friends!&mdash;cannot but be
  pleased with the characteristic portrait which accompanies the
  interesting memoir of that kind-hearted and accomplished gentleman.</p>

  <p><i>Oracles from the British Poets, A Drawing-Room Table Book and
  pleasant Companion for a Round Party</i>, by James Smith exhibits a good
  idea carried out with excellent taste, and justifies the author's
  motto:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Out of them scatter'd Sibyl's leaves,</p>
      <p>Strange prophecies my fancy weaves."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>A game which, while it amuses the family circle, will make its members
  acquainted with so many beautiful passages from our poets as are here
  assembled, must find a welcome in many a home at the present season. The
  publisher of the <i>Oracles</i> has availed himself of the demand, at
  this period of the year, for "Song of knight and lady bright," to
  re-issue in one volume instead of two, and at a reduced price, his
  <i>Pictorial Book of Ballads Traditional and Romantic</i>.</p>

  <p><i>A Monumentarium of Exeter Cathedral</i>, carefully compiled by the
  Rev. J.W. Hewett, the result of six months regular labour, has been
  printed in the <i>Transactions of the Exeter Architectural Society</i>.
  By this work Mr. Hewett has done good service to all genealogists, local
  and general historians, &amp;c., and we know no greater benefit that
  could be conferred on this branch of literature, than that some of our
  now super-abundant brass-rubbers should follow Mr. Hewett's example, and
  note with accuracy all the inscriptions, monuments, coats of arms,
  &amp;c., preserved in the churches in their respective neighbourhoods.
  They may then either hand them over for publication to the nearest
  Archæological Society, or the Archæological Institute, or the Society of
  Antiquaries; or transmit a copy of them to the MS. department of the
  British Museum.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
